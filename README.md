# community-garden

Community Garden is built for Facebook Hackathon in 2020 by [Yiting Liu](https://yitingliu.com) and Melissa Powers. 
You can play the filter here. (link tbd)

Check out our DEMO video here. 

## Process
1. Brainstorm to emphasis social and community. We concluded to build a dreamy environment of community garden. More people get to change the type of flowers following them. 
2. 3D model building (Daisy and Cherry Blossoms are created by Yiting, and two other flowers created by Melissa)
2. Patch Editor work (Yiting created the background and most of the code while Melissa helped.)
